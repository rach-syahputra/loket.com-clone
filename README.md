## About The Project
### Mini Loket: A clone of Loket.com
Welcome to our Event Management Platform!
This project is a collaborative adventure where our team set out to clone Loket.com—but with a twist. While we didn’t dive into every single feature, we captured the essentials and gave them our own spin. We wanted to learn the ropes of event management platforms without drowning in complex features. So, we focused on the essentials, kept it clean, and added just enough functionality to make it practical (and a bit fun). Is it perfect? Nope. Is it awesome? Absolutely.
